# Schoen Poll

This is my custom system for live polling an audience, put together with Gemini in a week and then improved over time.

Feel free to copy it.

 -- Nicolas Boumal, March 2026


## Setup

Create a [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com) project, free tier. No need for analytics.

In there:

1. Under Security -> Authentication, click "get started" and allow authentication both with Google and as Anonymous user.
2. Under Database & Storage, create a NoSQL Cloud Firestore database, standard edition (not a Realtime Database, see notes below).
3. Under the "Rules" tab, set the access rules for that database (copy-paste code below). Don't forget to *edit the list of admins*!
4. Under Security -> Authentication -> Settings -> Authorized domains, make sure to include the domain from where your webpages will be served (include localhost and 127.0.0.1 for local testing).
5. Under Settings -> General, under "Your Apps", select the "Web" icon to create your web app. (You may want to enable hosting too; I did not because I use GitHub Pages for hosting).
6. The previous step generated some text with a `firebaseConfig` object: copy this somewhere.

Then:

7. Copy the files from this repo and serve them from wherever (e.g., using Github Pages or Firebase hosting).
8. In `config.js`, copy your Firebase config data (see step 6, or go to Settings -> General in Firebase).
9. In `config.js`, also update `clickerUrl` with the full URL to your clicker (the `index.html` page).
10. That's also where you can edit the bubble colors, the questions you prepare ahead of time, the default answer-options, and the results-page styles.

Usage should be self explanatory. In a nutshell:

* Open the `admin.html` page on your phone: that's the remote.
* Have participants open the `index.html` page on their devices: that's the clicker.
* Open `results.html` on your lecture screen.
* Alternatively, look inside `results.html` and copy its relevant code to your setup: perfect for a [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/)-style presentation!
* The `history.html` page displays past questions and answers.


## Prepared questions and LaTeX

Questions can be written ahead of time in `config.js`, under `preparedQuestions`. Each entry has the answer `options`, an optional `question` text, and an optional private `label` for the history page:

```js
export const preparedQuestions = [
    {
        question: String.raw`Is $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$ convergent?`,
        options: ['Yes', 'No', 'Unsure'],
        label: "Harmonic series"
    }
];
```

They appear at the top of the admin remote's launchpad, above the usual question types. Launching one puts the question on the results page immediately, while the results stay hidden: the **Show question** / **Hide question** button on the remote toggles the text, and **Reveal answers** still toggles the bubbles, independently. Moving on to the next question hides both.

Both the question text and the answer options can contain LaTeX, written between `$...$` (inline) or `$$...$$` (displayed). It is typeset with [KaTeX](https://katex.org) (loaded from a CDN, like D3) on the results page, on the participants' clicker buttons, on the remote, and in the history. The only exception is the doughnut chart on the remote: it is drawn on a canvas by Chart.js, which shows the raw text.

In `config.js`, prefer ``String.raw`...` `` as above, so that backslashes can be written normally. With ordinary quotes, every backslash must be doubled: `"Is $\\pi$ rational?"`.

Two things to keep in mind:

* A question launched without prepared text (the usual "Yes / No" style buttons) simply has no question on screen, exactly as before.
* The Firestore rules below limit an answer to fewer than 100 characters, which is the LaTeX source of an option, not its rendered length. Long options need that limit raised.


## Side notes

* In Firebase, under Security -> Settings -> Sign-up quota, you will see that Firebase limits "the number of new Email/Password and Anonymous accounts that your application can create in a day from a single IP address". This may create friction with hundreds of students in a lecture room, connected on the same WiFi: they might have the same IP address. The client side webpage should instruct users to temporarily switch to cellular data if that happens (once they are logged in, it's fine: they can go back to WiFi). That said, you can also increase the quota ahead of the first lecture. The change only lasts for a few days though, and may take an hour to kick in.

* To display the results, you need to be logged in as an admin. If somehow this isn't the case on the machine that should display the results, do this: (1) open the remote (`admin.html`), (2) in the extra options below, click the log out button, and (3) log in again, making sure to use your admin account. (4) Reload the page that displays the results.

* The `results.html` page can be included as a "browser" source in [OBS](https://obsproject.com/): with the Results Style set to "None" in the admin remote (the default first style), its background is transparent. This provides a means to overlay the vote bubbles and the QR code on top of your powerpoint / keynote / iPad goodnotes or Notability / ... seamlessly, still controlled by the admin remote (on your phone). The overlay only appears on the screen you share or on the virtual camera, so the presenter view stays clean. On that note: the "Black bg" style is nice for use with a projector aimed at a board: the black background won't show, and the labels switch to white for contrast.

* Why Firestore and not real-time database? It's all about how Firebase's [free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) is structured. Firestore allows a few tens of thousands of reads and writes per day: that's fine for a dozen polls in a classroom with a few hundred students. If it's not enough, you can pay for more and it's very cheap (a few *cents* per lecture would do). In contrast, the real-time database would allow vastly more reads and writes per day for free, but it has a cap at 100 simultaneous connections. Since each student establishes a connection, that's a no-go for that free tier. That said, you could sign-up for the pay-as-you-go plan of the real-time database, which lifts the cap to 200'000 simultaneous connections. It is highly unlikely that your usage would ever exceed the free tier within the pay-as-you-go plan, and so this might be the superior option for large audiences. The only downsides would be that you have to attach a credit card to it, and that the code (here) would have to be rewritten partly (an LLM could do it).


## Firebase access rules

Set these rules through the Firebase console:

1. Select your Firestore in the left pane,
2. Click "Rules" in the horizontal menu,
4. Copy-paste the code below,
5. !! Edit the list of admins,
6. Click "Publish".

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // List one or more admins here.
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null && 
             request.auth.token.email in ["first-admin@gmail.com", "second-admin@gmail.com"];
    }

    // 0. By default, just say no.
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }

    // 1. The Live State
    match /state/live {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if isAdmin();
    }

    // 2. The Display State
    match /state/display {
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();
    }

    // 3. The Answers
    match /questions/{questionId}/answers/{userId} {
      // Read & Delete: Only check identity (no data payload exists to validate)
      allow read, delete: if isAdmin() || (request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId);
      
      // Create & Update: Check identity and validate the data payload
      allow create, update: if isAdmin() || (request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId && isValidAnswer());
    }

    // 4. The Question History
    match /questions/{questionId} {
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    // Limit what can be submitted as an answer by non-admins
    function isValidAnswer() {
      let data = request.resource.data;
      return data.keys().hasOnly(['choice', 'timestamp']) &&
             data.choice is string &&
             data.choice.size() < 100 &&
             data.timestamp == request.time; 
    }
  }
}
```
